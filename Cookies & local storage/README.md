This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum, focusing on web front-end development. The aim of this project is to deepen understanding and proficiency in working with cookies and browser web storage in JavaScript.

## Project Overview

The project covers various tasks aimed at understanding and implementing cookie manipulation, utilizing both traditional cookies and modern browser web storage features such as local storage and session storage. Each task builds upon the previous one, gradually introducing new concepts and techniques.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Understand how to create and manipulate cookies using JavaScript.
- Learn about setting specific settings for cookies, including expiration dates and paths.
- Gain proficiency in reading cookies with JavaScript.
- Utilize libraries such as js-cookie for simplified cookie manipulation.
- Understand the differences between local storage and session storage and their appropriate use cases.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Create Basic Cookie

- Implement basic cookie creation functionality.
- Set cookies for user data such as first name and email.
- Create functions to set and display cookies using vanilla JavaScript.

### Task 1: Create Cookie with Expiration Date and Specific Path

- Modify cookie creation to include an expiration date set to 10 days.
- Implement cookie creation with specific paths.

### Task 2: Read Cookie

- Develop functionality to read cookie values.
- Create functions to retrieve specific cookie values.

### Task 3: Delete Cookie and Mini Application

- Introduce functionality to delete cookies.
- Build a mini application involving user login/logout functionality using cookies.

### Task 4: Use js-cookie

- Integrate the js-cookie library for simplified cookie manipulation.
- Replace manual cookie manipulation with js-cookie functions.

### Task 5: Local Storage

- Utilize local storage to build a basic shopping cart application.
- Implement adding items to cart and displaying cart contents using local storage.

### Task 6: Session Storage

- Replace local storage usage with session storage.
- Build upon the shopping cart application using session storage.

### Task 7: Advanced Use of Web Storage

- Develop an advanced shopping cart system using session storage.
- Implement features such as adding, removing, and clearing items from the cart.

## Requirements

- Development environment setup using webpack-dev-server.
- Tasks completed using vanilla JavaScript.
- Files structured according to task requirements.
- Code compiled/executed on Ubuntu 18.04 using Node.js 12.x and npm 6.x.
