This repository contains a collection of JavaScript scripts focusing on advanced concepts.

## Description

This project aims to provide practical examples and exercises to deepen your understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts. Each task in this repository explores topics like lexical scoping, closure, DOM manipulation, and more. The tasks are designed to challenge your skills and improve your proficiency in JavaScript.

## Tasks

1. **Lexical Scoping and Welcome Message**
   - File: `Javascript_advanced/0-welcome.js`
   - Description: Create a function for displaying a welcome message using lexical scoping. Understand the concept of lexical scoping in JavaScript and how it affects variable access.

2. **Closure Scope Chain**
   - File: `Javascript_advanced/1-nested_functions.js`
   - Description: Demonstrate closure and scope chain with nested functions. Explore how closures can capture and remember the outer function's variables.

3. **Closure**
   - File: `Javascript_advanced/2-function_me.js`
   - Description: Implement closure with a function for displaying welcome messages. Understand how closures can be used to encapsulate and maintain state.

4. **Closure and Loops**
   - File: `Javascript_advanced/3-classrooms.js`
   - Description: Create closures for simulating classrooms with seat numbers. Learn how closures can be used to simulate private methods and manage state.

5. **Complex Closure**
   - File: `Javascript_advanced/4-math.js`
   - Description: Create closures for mathematical operations. Explore more complex use cases of closures in mathematical operations.

6. **Changing DOM with Closure**
   - File: `Javascript_advanced/5-mode.js`
   - Description: Use closures to change the page style based on button clicks. Learn how closures can be applied in manipulating the DOM.

7. **Private Methods with Closure**
   - File: `Javascript_advanced/6-hogwarts.js`
   - Description: Implement private methods in a module for simulating a Hogwarts student. Understand how closures can be used to encapsulate private methods and variables.

8. **Stack Order and setTimeout**
   - File: `Javascript_advanced/7-timeout.js`
   - Description: Log messages with different stack orders using setTimeout. Explore how the JavaScript execution stack and setTimeout interact.

9. **Stack Order in Functions**
   - File: `Javascript_advanced/8-payments.js`
   - Description: Simulate order processing with different stack orders. Understand the order of execution in JavaScript functions.

10. **Prime Numbers & Timing Execution**
    - File: `Javascript_advanced/9-prime.js`
    - Description: Measure the time to calculate prime numbers. Use the performance API to measure the execution time of a function.

11. **Execution Stack & Timing Execution**
    - File: `Javascript_advanced/10-prime.js`
    - Description: Execute the function to calculate prime numbers multiple times and measure time. Explore the impact of execution stack order on performance.

12. **Changing Stack Order using setTimeout**
    - File: `Javascript_advanced/11-prime.js`
    - Description: Use setTimeout to change the stack order in prime number calculations. Understand how setTimeout affects the stack order.

13. **Binding**
    - File: `Javascript_advanced/12-room_area.js`
    - Description: Implement object binding to calculate room area. Learn how binding can be used to set the context of a function.

14. **Binding + Closure**
    - File: `Javascript_advanced/13-bind_user.js`
    - Description: Use binding and closure to log welcome messages for a user. Explore the combination of binding and closures in function invocation.

15. **Simple Callback**
    - File: `Javascript_advanced/14-wikipedia.js`
    - Description: Use XMLHttpRequest to fetch data from Wikipedia with a callback function. Understand the basics of asynchronous programming and callbacks in JavaScript.
